# 📊 FreeCodeCamp Data Analysis Projects

Welcome to my **Data Analysis with Python** repository! 🚀 This repository contains five projects that are part of the **Data Analysis with Python Certification** from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). Each project focuses on **real-world data analysis** using **Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and NumPy** to explore, manipulate, and visualize data.

## 📂 Project Structure

Each project is organized into a separate folder within this repository:

1. **[Demographic Data Analysis]( )** 📈 - Analyzing census data to uncover insights about demographics and income distribution.
2. **[Medical Data Visualizer]( )** 🏥 - Exploring relationships between health markers and cardiovascular disease.
3. **[Page View Time Series Visualizer]( )** 📊 - Visualizing trends in website traffic data over time.
4. **[Sea Level Predictor]( )** 🌊 - Predicting future sea levels using historical data.
5. **[Mean-Variance Standard Deviation Calculator]( )** 🔢 - Statistical computations on numerical datasets.

Each folder contains the necessary scripts, datasets, and a **README** with project details and instructions.

## 🔧 Setting Up the Environment

To ensure a smooth workflow, I'm using **uv** 🐍 to manage dependencies efficiently. To set up your environment, follow these steps:

### 1️⃣ Install uv

```bash
pip install uv
```

### 2️⃣ Sync Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and run:

```bash
uv pip sync requirements.txt
```

This will install all required packages.

## 🚀 Running the Projects

Each project contains a main script that executes the analysis. Example:

```bash
python demographic_data_analyzer.py
```

Make sure you are in the correct project folder before running the script.

## 🏆 Certification Goal

This repository is part of my journey to earn the **Data Analysis with Python Certification** from freeCodeCamp. These projects help solidify skills in:
✅ Data Wrangling with Pandas\
✅ Data Visualization with Matplotlib & Seaborn\
✅ Statistical Analysis & Insights\
✅ Time Series & Predictive Modeling
